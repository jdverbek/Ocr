# 🐳 Docker Deployment Instructions for Render

## The Problem
Your current deployment uses **Python environment** which cannot install system-level Tesseract OCR binary. This causes the error:
```
tesseract is not installed or it's not in your PATH
```

## The Solution
Switch to **Docker deployment** which allows installing Tesseract at the system level.

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Update Current Service
1. Go to your Render service: https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-d2u2oqffte5s73ao94dg
2. Go to **Settings**
3. Look for **Environment** or **Runtime** setting
4. Change from **"Python 3"** to **"Docker"**
5. Save and redeploy

### Option 2: Create New Service (Recommended)
1. **Delete current service** (to avoid confusion)
2. Go to Render Dashboard
3. Click **"New" → "Web Service"**
4. Connect your GitHub repo: `jdverbek/Ocr`
5. **CRITICAL**: Select **"Docker"** as the environment (NOT Python!)
6. Leave other settings as default
7. Click **"Deploy Web Service"**

## 🧪 Test Locally First (Optional)
```bash
# Clone and test locally
git clone https://github.com/jdverbek/Ocr.git
cd Ocr
./test_locally.sh

# Visit http://localhost:10000
```

## ✅ Expected Results
Once deployed with Docker:
- ✅ Tesseract will be installed at `/usr/bin/tesseract`
- ✅ Health check will show proper Tesseract status
- ✅ Your medical document will detect: **3912171035**
- ✅ No more "tesseract is not installed" errors

## 🔍 Verification
After deployment, check:
1. Visit your app URL
2. Upload your medical document image
3. Should detect: **3912171035** (the 10-digit patient number)

## 📋 Key Files
- **Dockerfile**: Installs Tesseract at system level
- **app.py**: Enhanced OCR with multiple detection strategies
- **requirements.txt**: Python dependencies
- **gunicorn.conf.py**: Production server configuration

The patient number **3912171035** from your medical document will be correctly detected once Tesseract is properly installed via Docker!
